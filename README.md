# workCalendar

In this project I was tasked with creating a work day scheduler. This includes
a display of the current day at the top, timeblocks for standard business hours.
These timeblocks are color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present
or future. Within the timeblocks, you can enter an event and save the event
with the save button.
